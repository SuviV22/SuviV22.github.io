Coding Approach:
A function is called when the submit button is pressed. 
Then, a random number between 11 to 99 is generated using the in-built functions math.floor and math.random. 
The first and second digits are then extracted using mathematical calculations such as division to obtain the first digit, and modulus to obtain the second digit.
A for loop is run to identify each character in the string if it is a vowel or a consonant. This is done using the in-built function "match".
Once identified, the character is stored in an array. This array is later joined back to form a string using the in-built function "join".
